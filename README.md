# algorithmdb
The Aim of this project is to provide a collection of reusable Algorithms which can be used effectively in different scenarios. Objective here is to create a platform for the researchers who works on Data Mining, Encryption algorithms, ect.. It can also be used for Educational purposes.

As of now the languages supported are,
1. Java
2. JavaScript
3. Scala

If you want to add more languages please message me.

# Features
Reusable codes
Tested the Algorithm implementations with different set of datas and provided the statistics in the header comment, so that developers can choose and reuse the algorithm which solve their business problem

This project is Migrated from sourceforge. It is a 7 Year old project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/algorithmdb/)
